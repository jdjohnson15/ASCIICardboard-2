# ASCIICardboard-2
Upgraded version of original project that uses Unity. instead of Android Studio.

Like the original, it converts the phone's camera feed into ASCII symbols. This version adds lens correction and an improved frame rate. I added a fun feature that increases and decreases the number of symbols written to the screen over time, which one could interpret as making the feed more abstract or more concrete.

This version still uses my "purist" method, which involves using text objects for rendering the imagery. Of course, the frame rate could be improved further with a shader that simply assigns pre-determined textures for each "would-be" ASCII symbol. That maube be added in a future iteration.
